After inserting links in href (before adding anything else apart from Navbar), copy and paste the code of index.html in all other html files.
In all other html files, change the title according to what that file represents.
Observe that when we click on elements apart from "Home" in the navbar on the website, the names don't get highlighted. Only "Home" is getting highlighted.
This is because, notice that in index.html, the class for "home" contains "active" class.
So, in all other html files, remove the "active" class from home and paste that in the corresponding class which that html file is representing.
